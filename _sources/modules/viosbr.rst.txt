viosbr -- Backup/Restore the configuration of the VIOS
======================================================

.. contents::
   :local:
   :depth: 1


Synopsis
--------

Performs the operations for backing up and restoring the virtual and logical configuration of the Virtual I/O Server (VIOS).



Requirements
------------
The below requirements are needed on the host that executes this module.

- VIOS >= 2.2.5.0
- Python >= 2.7



Parameters
----------

  action (True, str, None)
    Specifies the operation to perform on the VIOS.

    ``backup`` to perform a backup.

    ``restore`` to restore a backup file.

    ``recoverdb`` to recover from a corrupted shared storage pool (SSP) database.

    ``migrate`` to migrate a backup file from an older release level to a current release level. A new file is created with ``_MIGRATED`` string appended to the given file name.

    ``dr`` to recover the cluster on another geographic location.

    ``list`` to view the listing of backup files.


  file (optional, str, None)
    Specifies the file name of the file that has backup information.

    For backup, compressed file is created with ``.tar.gz`` extension.

    For cluster backups, compressed file is created with ``<clustername>.tar.gz`` extension.

    If file name is a relative path, file is created under ``/home/padmin/cfgbackups``.


  dir (optional, str, None)
    User-specified location from where to list backup files when *action=list*.


  devtype (optional, str, None)
    Only restore devices of the specified type.


  clustername (optional, str, None)
    Specifies the cluster name to back up or restore, including all of its associated nodes.


  subfile (optional, str, None)
    Specifies the node configuration file to be restored.


  currentdb (optional, str, None)
    Restores the cluster without restoring the database from the backup.

    When restoring mapping, some of the mapping can fail if the mappings are not in the current database.


  force (optional, bool, False)
    Attempts to restore a device even if it has not been successfully validated.


  repopvs (optional, list, None)
    List of hdisks to be used as repository disks for restoring the cluster.

    The given disks must not contain a repository signature.


  skipcluster (optional, bool, False)
    Restores all local devices, except *cluster0*.


  skipdevattr (optional, bool, False)
    Skips the restore of the physical device attributes.

    Does not modify the current system's physical device attributes.


  validate (optional, bool, False)
    Validates the devices on the server against the devices on the backed-up file.

    Fails the restore operation if items do not validate successfully.





Notes
-----

.. note::
   - The *restore* action must be run on the same VIOS partition as the one where the backup was performed.
