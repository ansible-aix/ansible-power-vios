- VIOS >= 2.2.5.0
- Python >= 2.7



Parameters
----------

  level (optional, str, None)
    Specifies the security level settings to choose.

    Specifying ``high`` security level might cause stability or serviceability issues especially in a cluster environment.

    Mutually exclusive with *file*.


  rule (optional, str, None)
    Specifies the name of the rule to be applied.


  file (optional, str, None)
    Specifies the security rules file to be applied.

    Mutually exclusive with *level*.


  firewall (optional, dict, None)
    Specifies the firewall state and rules.


    ipv4 (optional, dict, None)
      Specifies the IPv4 firewall state and rules.


      active (optional, bool, None)
        Specifies the state of the firewall.


      default (optional, bool, None)
        Load default firewall rules.

        Mutually exclusive with *rules*.


      rules (optional, list, None)
        Specifies the list of firewall rules.


        present (optional, bool, True)
          Specifies whether the rule should be present or not.


        port (True, str, None)
          Specifies the port number or a service name from the ``/etc/services`` file.

          All the IP activity to and from that local port is allowed.


        interface (optional, str, None)
          Specifies the network interface name, like ``en0``.


        remote (optional, bool, False)
          Specifies that the port is a remote port.

          All the IP activity to and from that remote port is allowed.


        address (optional, str, None)
          IP address.


        timeout (optional, str, None)
          Timeout period.

          The timeout period can be specified as a number (in seconds), or with a number followed by ``m`` (minutes), ``h`` (hours), or ``d`` (days). The maximum timeout period is 30 days.




    ipv6 (optional, dict, None)
      Specifies the IPv6 firewall state and rules.


      active (optional, bool, None)
        Specifies the state of the firewall.


      default (optional, bool, None)
        Load default firewall rules.

        Mutually exclusive with *rules*.


      rules (optional, list, None)
        Specifies the list of firewall rules.


        present (optional, bool, True)
          Specifies whether the rule should be present or not.


        port (True, str, None)
          Specifies the port number or a service name from the ``/etc/services`` file.

          All the IP activity to and from that local port is allowed.


        interface (optional, str, None)
          Specifies the network interface name, like ``en0``.


        remote (optional, bool, False)
          Specifies that the port is a remote port.

          All the IP activity to and from that remote port is allowed.


        address (optional, str, None)
          IP address.


        timeout (optional, str, None)
          Timeout period.

          The timeout period can be specified as a number (in seconds), or with a number followed by ``m`` (minutes), ``h`` (hours), or ``d`` (days). The maximum timeout period is 30 days.








Notes
-----

.. note::
   - Applying a ``high`` security profile might cause stability or serviceability issues especially if the VIOS is part of a cluster environment.
